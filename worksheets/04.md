## Worksheet 4

1. Use Gaussian Elimination to determine if the following matrix is invertible. If so, determine the inverse.
$$
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & -1 & 1 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

2. Use Gaussian Elimination to determine if the following matrix is invertible. If so, determine the inverse.
$$
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        7 & 8 & 9 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

3. Determine which the following statements are true and which are false:
    - If a matrix is invertible, it has to be diagonal.
    - Diagonal matrices are invertible. 
    - If $A$ has a zero column, it is not invertible.
