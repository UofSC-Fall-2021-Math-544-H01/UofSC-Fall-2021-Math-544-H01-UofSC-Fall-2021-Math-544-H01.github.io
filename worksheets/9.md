1. Compute the LU factorization with partial pivoting of 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        F & T & F & F \\
        T & T & T & F \\
        F & T & T & T 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

2. Which the following are vector spaces and which are not:
    - The subset of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ lying on the graph 
    $y = x^2$. 
    - The set of orthogonal matrices. 
    - The set of lower triangular matrices. 
    - The set of symmetric matrices. A matrix is called _symmetric_ if $A = A^T$. 

3. Assume that $V_1$ and $V_2$ are 
$k$-vector spaces. Consider the set 
$$
    V_1 \times V_2 := \lbrace (v_1,v_2) \mid v_1 \in V_1, v_2 \in V_2 \rbrace 
$$
with $+$ given by 
$$
    (v_1,v_2) + (v_1^\prime,v_2^\prime) := (v_1+v_1^\prime, v_2+v_2^\prime)
$$
and $\cdot$ given by 
$$
    c \cdot (v_1, v_2) := (c\cdot v_1,c\cdot v_2).
$$
Prove that $V_1 \times V_2$ with these $+$ and $\cdot$ is a $k$-vector space. It 
is called the _product_ of $V_1$ and $V_2$.
