1. Which of the following are subspaces and which are not:
    - Upper triangular matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_{m,n}(k)$. 
    - Invertible matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_{n,n}(k)$.
    - Diagonal matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_{n,n}(k)$.
    - Square matrices satisfying $A^r = I$ for some $r$.

2. Find a spanning set for the null space of the matrix 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 2 & 2 & -1 \\
        1 & 1 & 2 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

3. Suppose we have two vectors spaces $V_1$ and $V_2$ with 
two subset $U_1 \subseteq V_1$ and $U_2 \subseteq U_2$. Is the 
following true?
$$
    \operatorname{Span}(U_1) \times \operatorname{Span}(U_2) =
    \operatorname{Span}(U_1 \times U_2)
$$
