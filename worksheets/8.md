1. Compute the reduced row echelon form of 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        8 & -11 & 43 & -2 & 3\\
        -3 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 5 \\
        4 & -2 & 2 & -2 & 1 \\
        2 & 8 & 5 & 4 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
in two ways. First by using the row operations in Sage one by one. Next by using 
the `.rref()` method on $A$. 

2. For the same $A$ as in 1, compute a LU factorization in two ways: using your 
list of row operations and using the `.LU()` method. 

3. This will acquiant you a bit more with some of the syntax for common types 
in Python/Sage. One way to declare a list in Python is 
```python
L = [1,2,3] # a list consisting of 1,2,3
```
Suppose you want to print out each element of the list one by one
```python
for x in L:
    print(x)
```
If you want second entry out of L you would write 
```python
L[1]
```
since Sage starts counting at 0. An example of a function declaration in Python (and hence Sage) is 
```python
def f(x):
    return x+5
```
Write a function in Sage that consumes a matrix and returns the sum of all entries in 
the matrix. Test it out on the matrix from 1. Hint: `A.list()`.
