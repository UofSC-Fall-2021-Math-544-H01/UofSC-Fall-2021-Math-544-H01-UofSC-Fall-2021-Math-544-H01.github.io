## Worksheet 1

1. What is the coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix for the following system of linear equations:
$$
 x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\
 2x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 = 2 \\
 x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 = 2.
$$

2. Solve the system given in Problem 1 using the algorithm described in the 
[notes]({% link notes/solving_linear_systems/systems.md %}#algorithm-for-solving-a-system-of-linear-equations)

3. For the matrix 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -2 & 0 & 1 \\
    3 & 0 & 4 & -1 \\
    5 & 5 & 5 & 5 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
write out the set of column vectors and row vectors. 

4. Compute the transpose of the matrix in Problem 3. 

5. For the matrices 
$$ A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 
\end{pmatrix} \ , \
B = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    -3 & -1 & 0\\
    2 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix} \ , \
\mathbf{v} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
    1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} \ , \ 
\mathbf{w} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
    1 \\
    1 \\
    1 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Compute all the products (as matrices) that are well-defined. Which ones are not well-defined?

6. Which of the following statements are true?
- For any two matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same size, we always have $A + B = B + A$ 
- For any two matrices $A$ and $B$, we always have $AB = BA$.
- For any two square matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same size, we always have $AB = BA$. 

7. For any three matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$, either 
- both $(AB)C$ and $A(BC)$ are not well-defined or 
- $(AB)C = A(BC)$.

Can you convincingly explain why? A professional mathematician would say *matrix multiplication is associative*. 

8. We have the following problem: we want to find a cubic polynomial
$$
 p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
$$
such that $p(1) = 5$, $p^\prime(1) = 5$, $p(2) = 17$, and $p^\prime(2) = 21$. What does this have to do with 
linear algebra?
