1. Does the matrix
$$
    A =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & -1 & -1 \\
        1 & 1 & -3 \\
        -2 & 1 & 2 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
have an LU decomposition? If so, find it. 

2. Does the matrix
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & -1 & 4 \\
        1 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\
        -2 & 1 & 2 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
have an LU decomposition? If so, find it.

3. For any matrix in 1 or 2 that does not have an LU decomposition, can you find a 
permutation matrix $P$ so that $PA$ does?
