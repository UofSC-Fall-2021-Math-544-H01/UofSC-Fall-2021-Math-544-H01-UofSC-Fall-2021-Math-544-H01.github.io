## Worksheet 2

1. Aside from the zero matrix $0$, all of whose entries are $0$, the next 
simplest matrix is one where exactly one entry is not zero. We let 
$D(i,j)\_m$ denote the $m \times m$ matrix whose only non-zero entry 
is a $1$ in position $(i,j)$. 

    Write down all possible $2 \times 2$ matrices $D(i,j)$. How many are there? 
    Can you figure out a general formula for the number of $m \times m$ 
    $D(i,j)$'s?

2. Any matrix $A$ is a linear combination of $D(i,j)$'s. Indeed, convince 
yourself that 
$$
    A = \sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} D(i,j). 
$$
In this way, if we can understand the behavior of the $D(i,j)$, then we 
can hope to extend that understanding to a general matrix. 

    Along this vein, what is a formula for the product 
    $$
        D(i,j) D(r,s) \ ? 
    $$
    (Hint: write down the $2 \times 2$ and see if you can spot a pattern in 
    $j$ and $r$ which tells you whether the product is $0$ or not.)

3. Let's walk through a proof that, for $i \neq j$,
$$
    L(i,j,c) L(i,j,-c) = I. 
$$
    * First, express $L(i,j,c)$ in terms of $I$, $D(i,j)$, and $c$.
    * Now, express $L(i,j,-c)$ in terms of $I$, $D(i,j)$, and $-c$.
    * Multiply these expressions together and use matrix algebra to 
        expand the product. 
    * Use what we learned in 2 to simplify
    
(You can understand this matrix formula by reasoning through the corresponding row 
operations. If I add $c$ copies of $\mathbf{R}_i$ to $\mathbf{R}_i$ and then I 
subtract $c$ copies of $\mathbf{R}_i$, I end up having done nothing. )
