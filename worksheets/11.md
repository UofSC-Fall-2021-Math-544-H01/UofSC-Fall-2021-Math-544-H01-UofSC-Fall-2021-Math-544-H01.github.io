1. Determine which subsets of the set 
$$
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$
are linearly dependent and which are linearly independent. (You are going to 
want to ask Sage for some help.)

2. Find a linearly independent spanning set for the span of the vectors from problem 1.

3. Determine whether the following statements are true or false:
    - Any vector space has a finite linearly independent spanning set. 
    - Suppose $V$ is a vector space and $U \subseteq V$ is subspace. If $S$ 
    is a linearly independent set of vectors in $U$, then $S$ is a linearly 
    independent set of vectors in $V$. 
    - In the vector space $\operatorname{Func}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$, the set
    $$
        e^x, e^{2x}, e^{3x}, \ldots, e^{mx}
    $$
    is linearly independent for any $m > 0$.
