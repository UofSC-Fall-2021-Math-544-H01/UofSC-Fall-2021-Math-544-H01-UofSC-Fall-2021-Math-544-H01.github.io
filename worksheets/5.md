1. For what $\mathbf{b}$ does $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ have a solution if 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 2 \\
        -1 & -3 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \ ?
$$

2. Let
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 2 \\
        1 & 0 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

    Row reduce $A$ and find a parametric presentation for $\mathcal Z(A)$. Use you parametric presentation 
    of $\mathcal Z(A)$ to find a $B$ with 
    $$
        \mathcal Z(A) = \mathcal R(B)
    $$

    Note this is the converse statement to what we saw in the 
    [notes]({% link notes/solving_linear_systems/equations_for_solvable_systems.md %}) 
    which said that the range of any matrix is the null space of another matrix. 

3. For any $A$ does there exist a $B$ such that 
$$
    \mathcal Z(A) = \mathcal R(B) \ ?
$$  
Provide a proof or counterexample. This would say the null space of any matrix is equal to the 
range of another matrix.
