## Formulae for the determinant

[Previously]({% link notes/linear_transformations/determinants.md %}) 
we gave a specification for how the determinant should behave. We 
use this to deduce some rather impressive features of the 
determinant. Note that we can say _the_ determinant as we 
[know]({% link notes/linear_transformations/determinants.md %}) 
any two determinants are equal.
