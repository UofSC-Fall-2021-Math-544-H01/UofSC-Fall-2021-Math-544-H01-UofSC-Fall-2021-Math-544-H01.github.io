## Formulae for the determinant

[Previously]({% link notes/linear_transformations/determinants.md %}) 
we gave a specification for how the determinant should behave. We 
use this to deduce some rather impressive features of the 
determinant. Note that we can say _the_ determinant as we 
[know]({% link notes/linear_transformations/determinants.md %}#) 
any two determinants are equal. 

Here we turn to giving one determinant and a formula. The 
formula is, perhaps, the most common one. However, computing 
determinants through Gaussian Elimination is generally faster. 
The 
[Bareiss algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareiss_algorithm) 
is the most common one used.
