* Some project suggestions are out! Check the Teams channel for the ideas. As I 
mentioned before, the best project is the one you are passionate about. Let me know 
your thoughts and we can work together to find some direction. Projects need to be 
selected by the end of this month. 

* A couple of students have been having issues with feedback not attaching to 
their returned assignments. Let me know if you are having this problem. I will 
try to stick to the Teams feedback box as much as reasonably possible.
