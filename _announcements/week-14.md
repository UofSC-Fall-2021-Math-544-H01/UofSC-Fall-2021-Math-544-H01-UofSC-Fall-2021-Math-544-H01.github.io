to teach more Honors courses, including possibly _your_ future class, 
please be sure to communicate this in your evaluation. 

    If you especially enjoyed the course, consider 
    [nominating me](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/honorsandawards/internal/nominations.php) 
    for a Mungo Undergraduate Teaching Award. 

* There will be worksheets for next week's classes but no quizzes.
