* Please bring a blank sheet of paper for writing your quiz. 

* If you have one, please bring a device to view webpages to class. You might find devices 
with a pen/pencil useful, like an iPad, but they will not be necessary. 

    If you have an iOS device, download the [Scribble app](https://scribbletogether.com/). 
    I have a subscription so you don't need to buy anything. 

    If you don't have a iOS device, I will post a link in Teams to the Scribble webpage 
    for you to view in your browser. 

* I am developing the notes as course goes. If you find something confusing, please
contact me and ask about it. The page is currently built with Jekyll and 
[hosted via Github](https://github.com/UofSC-Fall-2021-Math-544-H01/UofSC-Fall-2021-Math-544-H01-UofSC-Fall-2021-Math-544-H01.github.io) 
using Github Pages. 

    So if you feel comfortable, that is medium where you can comment. There you can point exactly 
    to the relevant line the markdown source. Pull requests fixing typos are very welcome!
