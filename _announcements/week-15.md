title: Week 15 Announcement
week: 15

* Course evaluations are now open for this course. If you want me 
to teach more Honors courses, including possibly _your_ future class, 
please be sure to communicate this in your evaluation. If we get to 
75% class participation, everyone's lowest homework score will be 
dropped.

* If you especially enjoyed the course, consider 
[nominating me](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/honorsandawards/internal/nominations.php) 
for a Mungo Undergraduate Teaching Award. Much like the evaluations, 
instructors are not told the nominator to avoid influence. 

* There will be worksheets for next week's classes but no quizzes. 

* If you want to turn things in for revision, be sure to have it 
in by the Exam Date - December 9 at 9:00 am (EST). Sooner is better 
as I have to submit grades shortly afterwards. 

* Also, projects are due by the Exam Date - December 9 at 9:00 am (EST).
