* I've added calculated totals, for ease of reference, to the 
gradebook in Teams for your homework, quiz, and presentation score 
accurate as of 3:00 pm 12/6. 
Each is normalized to be out of 100. 
[Remember]({% link about.md %}#evaluation-and-grading-scale) 
your final grade is computed as 1/4 from each of these and 1/4 
from your final project. 

* If you want to turn things in for revision, be sure to have it 
in by the Exam Date - December 9 at 9:00 am (EST). Sooner is better 
as I have to submit grades shortly afterwards. 

* Also, projects are due by the Exam Date - December 9 at 9:00 am (EST). 
If you turn your project in advance and it gets returned, you can 
revise it until the Exam Date. 

* Course evaluations are now open for this course. If you want me 
to teach more Honors courses, including possibly _your_ future class, 
please be sure to communicate this in your evaluation. If we get to 
75% class participation, everyone's lowest homework score will be 
dropped.

* If you especially enjoyed the course, consider 
[nominating me](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/honorsandawards/internal/nominations.php) 
for a Mungo Undergraduate Teaching Award. Much like the evaluations, 
instructors are not told the nominator to avoid influence.
use the time to revise past assignments and work on the project.
