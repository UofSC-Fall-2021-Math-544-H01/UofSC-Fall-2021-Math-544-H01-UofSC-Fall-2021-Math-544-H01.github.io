* A batch of assignments are were graded on Monday and returned. I scattered the revision 
dates throughout next week. If you need an extension, let me know. 

* We are starting a more abstract and conceptual component of the course. The experience 
so far will help inform and ground you through explicit examples of general concepts. 
Thinking abstractly is a core function of doing mathematics and a tool that helps in 
any problem solving endeavour. That said, it is probably the most unfamiliar part of the 
course. If you need support, just reach out to me.
