* My office hours have changed to Tuesdays and Thursdays 7:45-8:30 and 11:30-12:15. 

* I would like to see how submitting the quiz via Teams goes. Please download and install either the 
    - [OneDrive Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive&hl=en_US&gl=US) or 
    - [OneDrive iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onedrive/id477537958)

    on your phone. Sign in with your UofSC ID and password. When you are done on Tuesday, scan your quiz, upload it to your 
    university OneDrive account, and then attach it to the quiz 3 assignment. 

* For each student, I have created a shared folder with me in your university OneDrive account. I will use this return 
assignments. If you are having trouble with accessing it, please message me on Teams.

* With a big assist from university IT, I have added a GitHub bot to the team for the class. The bot will report 
any updates to the course webpage in the 
[webpage channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a129842a8bd4a4a2c8f5fa640bcef0f1e%40thread.tacv2/Website?groupId=5ff176b0-5dbd-44cb-a436-ec0c668e897e&tenantId=4b2a4b19-d135-420e-8bb2-b1cd238998cc). 
This way you only need to keep an eye Teams to stay up to date about website changes.
