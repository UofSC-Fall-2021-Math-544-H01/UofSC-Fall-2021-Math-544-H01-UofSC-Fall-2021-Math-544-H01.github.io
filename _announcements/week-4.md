* The first versions of Homework 1, Quiz 3, and Quiz 4 were returned on Friday. The due for revisions is this Friday, Sept 10. 
The first revisions for Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 were returned on Monday. The due date for the second (and final) revisions is 
next Monday Sept 13. 

* Reminder: all returned individual work will be put in the UofSC OneDrive folder shared personally with me. Each group 
assignment has its own folder shared between the group members and myself. If you have any trouble locating any folders, 
just let me know. 

* I get lots of email. On the other hand, I only get MS Teams' messages from people in this class. If you want to contact me, 
sending your message via Teams gives it greater prominence than an email would.
