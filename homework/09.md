## {{ page.title }} - QR factorizations and linear transformations

1. Find the QR decomposition of 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
        -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\
        0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
        -1 & 1 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

2. Assume we have a QR factorization 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} & \frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}} \\
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
    \end{pmatrix} 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & \frac{2}{3} & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & \frac{1}{2} \\
        0 & 0 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
Without resorting to Sage, compute the inverse of $A$. (Hint: these 
particular type of matrices have simple formulas for inverses.)

3. Assume that $T: V \to W$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces. For each 
$w \in W$ pick some $v \in V$ with $T(v) = w$ and define 
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        T^{-1} : W & \to V \\
        w & \mapsto v
    \end{aligned}
$$
Show that this is a well-defined function and is a linear transformation.

4. Again assume that $T$ is an isomorphism and $T^{-1}$ is as in problem 3. Show that 
$$
    T(T^{-1}(w)) = w
$$
for all $w \in W$ and 
$$
    T^{-1}(T(v)) = v
$$
for all $v \in V$. This says that $T^{-1}$ is the _inverse to $T$ under composition_. 

5. Given two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ show that $\operatorname{Map}(V,W)$, the 
set of linear transformations from $V$ to $W$, has the structure of a vector space. 

    For a $v \in V$, show the function 
    $$
        \begin{aligned}
            ev_v : \operatorname{Map}(V,W) & \to W \\
            T & \mapsto T(v) 
        \end{aligned}
    $$
    is a linear transformation.
