## Homework 6 - Bases and dimension

**_Due {{ page.date }}_**. 

1. Determine which subsets of the set of vectors
$$  
    \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \
    \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
$$
are linearly independent. 

2. Show that the dimension of the space of solutions to the linear differential 
equation 
$$
    f^{\prime \prime}(x) - f(x) = 0 
$$
is at least two. (Hint: what functions do you know which are equal to 
their second derivatives?) 

3. Show that 
$$
    \dim (V_1 \times V_2) = \dim V_1 + \dim V_2
$$

4. Suppose $U$ is a subspace of a vector space $V$. We define the _quotient_ 
$$
    V/U := \lbrace [v] \mid v \in V, [v_1] = [v_2] \text{ if } v_1-v_2 \in U \rbrace
$$
So for each $v \in V$ we have a symbol $[v]$ and two symbols are equal if the 
difference of their labels lies in $U$. 
    
    Show that $V/U$ with 
    $$
        [v_1] + [v_2] := [v_1+v_2]
    $$
    and 
    $$
        c[v] := [cv]
    $$
    is a vector space. (Note: the key part of this is making sure $+$ and $\cdot$ 
    don't change if you replace $[v]$ with $[v+u]$ for some $u \in U$.)

5. Suppose $S$ is a spanning set of $V$ and $U$ is a subspace. Show $[v_i]$ for $
i \in S$ is a spanning set for $V/U$. Conclude that $\dim V/U \leq \dim V$.
