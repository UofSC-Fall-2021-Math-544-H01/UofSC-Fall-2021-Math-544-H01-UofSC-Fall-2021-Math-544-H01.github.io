## Homework 7 - Inner products and Gram Schmidt

**_Due {{ page.date }}_**. 

1. Let $\langle -,- \rangle$ be a bilinear pairing on a vector 
space $V$. Let $W \subseteq V$ be a subspace. We define the 
_orthogonal_ to be the subset  
$$
    W^{\perp} = \lbrace v \in V \mid \langle v,w \rangle = 0 ~\forall w \in W \rbrace
$$
Show that $W^{\perp}$ is also a subspace of $V$. 

2. Continuing with the set up from Problem 4. If $\langle -,- \rangle$ is an 
inner product and $V$ is finite dimensional, show that 
$$
    W = \left( W^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}
$$
