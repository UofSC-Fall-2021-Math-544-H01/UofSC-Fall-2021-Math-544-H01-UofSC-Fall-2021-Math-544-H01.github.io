## Homework 4 - Geometry and Sage

**_Due {{ page.date }}_**. 

1. Show that $f_A$ is surjective if and only if $\mathcal R(A) = \mathbb{R}^m$.

2. Recall that $A$ is orthogonal if $A^T = A^{-1}$. Show that $A$ is orthogonal if and only if $f_A$ preserves 
distance in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hint: we can compute distance using the dot product of vectors 
$$
    \text{dist}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{ \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} }
$$

3. Given an example of an orthogonal matrix that is not a permutation matrix. 

4. Write a function in Sage whose input is a matrix of any shape and whose output is the sum of 
the absolute values of the entries of the matrix. 

5. Use Sage to determine the reduced row echelon form and the LU factorization, with 
partial pivoting, of the matrix 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 3 \\
        5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 3 \\
        1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\
        3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0  
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
