## Homework 3 - Solvability and LU factorizations

**_Due {{ page.date }}_**. 

1. Find a matrix $B$ whose null space equals the range of the matrix
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        3 & 4 \\
        5 & 6 \\ 
        7 & 8 \\
        9 & 10 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

2. Determine if the following matrix $A$ has an LU factorization. If not, can 
you find a permutation matrix $P$ such that $PA$ has an LU factorization? 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 2 \\
        -2 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

3. Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two lower triangular matrices:
    - Show that $L_1 + L_2$ is lower triangular. 
    - If both $L_1$ and $L_2$ are square, show that $L_1 L_2$ is also lower triangular. 

4. A matrix $A$ is called _orthogonal_ if $A^{-1} = A^T$. In other words, $A$ is 
an orthogonal matrix if its inverse is equal to its transpose. Show that any 
permutation matrix is orthogonal. 

5. Show that the product of two orthogonal matrices is also orthogonal.
