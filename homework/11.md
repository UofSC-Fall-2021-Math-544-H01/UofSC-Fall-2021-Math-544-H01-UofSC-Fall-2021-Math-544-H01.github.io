## {{ page.title }} - Rank, nullity, and eigenvectors

1. Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix of rank $r$. Show that 
there exists an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $C$ and 
an invertible $m \times m$ matrix $D$ with 
$$
    D^{-1} A C = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    1 & & & & & & \\
     & 1 & & & & & \\
    & & \ddots & & & &\\
    & & & 1 & & & \\
    & & & & 0 & & \\
    & & & & & \ddots & \\
    & & & & & & 0 
    \end{pmatrix} 
$$
where the off diagonal entries are $0$. (Hint: choose a basis 
$v_1,\ldots,v_d$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $v_{r+1},\ldots,v_m$ 
is a basis of $\mathcal Z(A)$. Then, use the basis for $\mathbb{R}^m$ 
of the form $Av_1,\ldots,Av_r,w_{r+1},\ldots,w_m$.)

2. What is the rank and nullity of 
$$
    \frac{d^i}{dx^i}: \operatorname{Poly}_n(\mathbb{R}) \to 
    \operatorname{Poly}_n(\mathbb{R})
$$
for each $i > 0$? 

3. If $v$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$ 
for an invertible $T: V \to V$, show that $v$ is also an eigenvector 
for $T^{-1}$. What is its eigenvalue?

4. Let $T,S: V \to V$ be linear transformations. Show that if $v$ is 
an eigenvector for both $T$ and $S$, then $v$ is an eigenvector 
for $T \circ S$. Find a formula for the eigenvalue of $v$ for the 
composition $T \circ S$ in terms of the eigenvalues for $T$ and 
$S$. 

5. Suppose $T,S: V \to V$ are linear transformations with 
$T \circ S = S \circ T$. Show that 
$$
    S: E_\lambda(T) \to E_\lambda(T)
$$
is well-defined. (Hint: you need to show that if $v$ is a 
$T$-eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$ then $S(v)$ is 
also a $T$-eigenvector with eigenvlaue $\lambda$.)
