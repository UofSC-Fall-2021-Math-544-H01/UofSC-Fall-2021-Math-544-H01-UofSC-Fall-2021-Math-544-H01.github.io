## Homework 2 - Gaussian elimination and invertibility

**_Due {{ page.date }}_**. 

1. Show that for $c \neq 0$
$$
    S(i,c) S(i,1/c) = I. 
$$
Is $S(i,c)$ invertible if $c = 0$?

2. We already saw that if $A$ and $B$ are invertible then so is $AB$. Use induction 
to show: if $A_1,\ldots,A_t$ are all invertible, then the product 
$A_1 \cdots A_t$ are invertible. 

3. Prove that the only invertible matrices in reduced row echelon form are the 
identity matrices. Hint: look at the number of $0$ rows in a square 
reduced row echelon matrix. What can you say about the number of pivots? How are 
you going to squeeze all those pivots in?

4. Use Gaussian elimination to determine if the following matrix has an inverse. 
Compute the inverse if it exists. 
$$
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & -2 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

5. Use Gaussian elimination to determine if the following matrix has an inverse. 
Compute the inverse if it exists. 
$$
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        7 & 8 & 9
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
