## Homework 5 - Vector spaces, subspaces, and spanning sets

**_Due {{ page.date }}_**. 

1. Find a spanning set for the null space of the matrix
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -1 & 2 & -3 & 4 & 2\\
        3 & -2 & 1 & -4 & -1\\
        1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

2. Determine if the following are subspaces of 
$\operatorname{Func}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ or not:
    - The set of odd functions. Recall
    that $f$ is odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
    - The set of solutions to the differential equation 
    $$
        \frac{d^2f}{dx^2} + 3 \frac{df}{dx} + 2 f = e^x.
    $$
    - The set of injective functions. 
    - The set of surjective functions. 

3. Find the LU factorization, with partial pivoting, of 
$$
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 1 
    \end{pmatrix}
$$
over both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{F}_2$. 

4. Prove the [Proposition]({% link notes/vector_spaces/spans.md %}#spanning-sets-for-null-spaces) 
from the notes that describes spanning sets for null spaces of matrices. 

5. - Give a set that is closed under scalar multiplication but not addition. 
    - Give a set that is closed under addition but not scalar multiplication. 
    - Give a set that is closed under neither.
