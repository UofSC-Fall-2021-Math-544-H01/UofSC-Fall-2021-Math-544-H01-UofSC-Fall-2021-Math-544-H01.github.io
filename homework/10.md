## {{ page.title }} - Bases and isomorphisms

1. Show that a $n \times n$ matrix is a change of basis matrix if and only if 
it is invertible.

2. We define a relation $\sim$ on $\operatorname{Mat}_{m,n}(k)$ by writing 
$A \sim B$ if there exist an invertible $m \times m$ matrix $C$ and an 
invertible $n \times n$ matrix $D$ with 
$$
    B = CAD
$$
Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. From the previous problem, 
$A \sim B$ is equivalent to saying that $A$ has $B$ as its matrix representation 
in different bases. 

3. Show that if $V_1 \cong V_2$ and $W_1 \cong W_2$, then $V_1 \times W_1 \cong V_2 \times W_2$.

4. Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space with a positive definite 
inner product $\langle -,- \rangle$ and $U \subseteq V$ is a subspace. Show that the 
composition 
$$
    U^{\perp} \to V \to V/U
$$
is an isomorphism $U^{\perp} \cong V/U$. (Hint: compute the dimensions of each.)

5. The dual space of a vector space $V$ is the space of linear transformations 
$V \to k$, called $\operatorname{Map}(V,k)$ previously. The dual space is usually 
denoted by $V^\ast$. Show that if $V \cong W$, then $W^\ast \cong V^\ast$. (Hint: 
given an isomorphism $T: V \to W$ and linear transformation $\psi: W \to k$ 
how can you combine them to get a linear transformation $V \to k$?)
